The proposed approach builds upon previous work [21], but it is an enhancement and with wide applicability.

There are some additional details that need to be added to the paper to provide completeness.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Page 2, line 30, there are some minor errors: in Equation (20), notation $u_i^{k+1}$ is from [24] and does not follow the paper's adopted notation.


\item In spite of being presented in the Introduction, none of the methods in [11], [14] was used to be compared in Numerical Experiments. 

\item ...

\item Comparing the computation times of the proposed method and others would help the readers have a better idea of the accuracy/computation time trade-off achieved [Ref.1]. \\
